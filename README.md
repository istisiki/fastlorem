## FAQ

**Q: Does this work offline?**

A: Do you have a browser or at least a text editor? Then, yes.

**Q: Can I customize the number of paragraphs?**

A: Currently, the count is randomized automatically. I don't know if I will add customizations. That feels slow. We want fast.

**Q: Why doesn't the copy button work?**

A: Make sure you're using a modern browser and the site is served over HTTPS (required for Clipboard API).

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**

A: Go for it.
